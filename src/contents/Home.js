        <h1>2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p>Tamil Nadu's politics have been dominated by the state's two leading parties, 
            Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), 
            for the last 50 years. In 2011, the AIADMK under J. Jayalalithaa handily defeated the DMK 
            headed by M. Karunanidhi. During the 2016 assembly elections, the AIADMK retained its majority 
            with 136 seats, while the DMK increased its strength to 98 seats.[5] 2021's sixteenth assembly 
            election is the first state poll after the death of the two key leaders, Jayalalithaa and 
            Karunanidhi, who died in 2016 and 2018 respectively. After Jayalalithaa's demise, the AIADMK 
            assumed a co-leadership under the party's legislative assembly leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami 
            and acting chief minister O. Panneerselvam in 2017. Subsequently, Palaniswami replaced Paneerselvam 
            as chief minister, while the latter became the deputy chief-minister of the state and the 
            coordinator of the party. After Karunanidhi's demise in 2018, Karunanidhi's son 
            M. K. Stalin, former deputy chief minister of Tamil Nadu, became the unquestioned DMK president.
             In the 2019 Indian parliamentary elections, the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance swept Tamil Nadu, 
             winning a whopping 38 out of 39 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state. In the bye-elections to the assembly during the same period, 
             the DMK won 13 seats while the AIADMK won 10.</p>
